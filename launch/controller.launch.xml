<!-- 
    ROS 2 launch files allow you to start up and configure complex robotic 
    systems composed of multiple ROS 2 nodes simultaneously. They can be written
    in either Python, XML or YAML: in this course we will focus on XML since it is
    the most user friendly format.
    ROS 2 launch files are special Python files that contain a function named
    generate_launch_description. This function must return a LaunchDescription
    object that represents the sets of actions that ROS should execute to start
    the system.
    
    NOTE: setup.py must also be updated to start using launch files

<launch>
  <!-- Create a launch argument. It can be used to supply values on the command line, 
       with the following syntax: ros2 launch <package_name> <launch_file> thymio_name:=thymio1 -->
  <arg name="thymio_name" default="thymio0"/>
  
  <!-- 
       Start a ROS node, equivalent to: ros2 run <package_name> <executable_name> 
       
       The `namespace` option launches controller_node in the namespace defined by 
       the `thymio_name` launch argument (default: /thymio0). Combined with the use of
       relative topic names in controller_node, this provides a nice way to specify which 
       robot this node should control.
       
       The `output` option configures the node to print to the terminal, to help with debugging.
       By default, nodes launched from a launch file print their output to a log file.

  <node pkg="thymio_example" exec="controller_node" namespace="$(var thymio_name)" output='screen' />
</launch>
